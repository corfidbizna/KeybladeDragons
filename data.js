        bio: `The great Earthshaker pulled Kingdom Key from a deceivingly strong Keyblade. The blade in question holds a unique power and always manages to find itself in key places at the right timesâ€”a trait not lost in transition to dragon. 

Kingdom Key isn't one to talk much, but he's always willing to help you out in a pinch. He's a notoriously subtle teacherâ€”some dragons only realizing the lesson has taken place long after it happened. If you see Kingdom Key within earshot when such realizations are exclaimed aloud, you'll catch hints of a smirk on his face.`,

Lady Luck is a highly laid-back individual. She's never been one for keeping to commitments and often shirks any responsibilities that she finds too large. However, she has a very sweet demeanor and a vivid imagination. With a calm, airy voice shell spin you as many fanciful tales as you wish to hear.`,

He always takes the hands-on approach when dealing with the challenges of both life and of the arena. There's no barrier he feels he can't overcome with raw power, effort, and a little showmanship for his admirers. `,
